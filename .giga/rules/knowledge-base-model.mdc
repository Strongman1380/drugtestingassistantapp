# knowledge-base-model

## Core Knowledge Structure
The knowledge base consists of three interconnected components focused on drug testing domain expertise:

### Drug Reference System (src/data/drugDatabase.js)
Importance Score: 90/100
- Structured database of drug testing parameters
- Detection window mappings for multiple specimen types
- Metabolite tracking system
- DEA scheduling classifications
- Street name reference tables
- Route of administration catalog
- Drug category cross-referencing

### Clinical Assistant Knowledge (src/data/aiKnowledgeBase.js)
Importance Score: 80/100
- Collection protocol documentation
- Result interpretation matrices
- Clinical cutoff reference tables
- Chain of custody procedures
- Adulterant detection guidelines
- THC/Creatinine ratio calculation rules

### Vision Analysis Prompt System (api/vision.js)
Importance Score: 85/100
- Specialized SVT strip analysis prompts
- Color interpretation rulesets
- Confidence scoring framework
- Clinical validation response structure

## Knowledge Integration Points

### SVT Parameter Mapping
- OX/PCC adulterant detection
- Creatinine concentration ranges
- Specific gravity measurements
- pH validity parameters

### Multi-Specimen Support
- Urine testing protocols
- Oral fluid procedures
- Specimen-specific metabolite tracking
- Type-specific detection windows
