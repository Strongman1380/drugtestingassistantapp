# svt-algorithms

## Color Analysis Matrix
Located in `src/data/svtColorData.js`, implements comprehensive color interpretation for specimen validity testing:

### Core Parameters
1. OX/PCC (Oxidants/PCC)
- Detects adulterants through color mapping
- Maps specific color ranges to adulteration indicators

2. Creatinine Analysis
- Valid range: 20-400 mg/dL
- Color matrix maps to concentration levels
- Interprets specimen dilution status

3. Specific Gravity
- Range validation: 1.003-1.030
- Density analysis through color correlation
- Maps color intensities to gravity values

4. pH Analysis
- Valid range: 4.0-9.0
- Color mapping for pH level determination
- Flags specimens outside acceptable ranges

## Vision Analysis System
Located in `api/vision.js`, provides automated SVT strip interpretation:

### Key Components
1. Color Interpretation Algorithm
- Processes SVT strip photographs
- Maps detected colors to clinical parameters
- Validates against established ranges

2. Confidence Scoring
- Evaluates color matching accuracy
- Determines result reliability
- Flags uncertain interpretations

### Result Validation
- Structured response format
- Clinical validation rules
- Parameter-specific acceptance criteria

### Integration Points
- Links with color matrix data
- Provides standardized interpretation outputs
- Supports clinical decision workflows

Importance Score: 95/100
