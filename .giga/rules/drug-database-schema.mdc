# drug-database-schema

## Core Structure
The drug reference database (`src/data/drugDatabase.js`) implements a comprehensive categorization system with the following key components:

### Drug Entity Model
- Detection window tracking for multiple specimen types:
  - Urine testing windows
  - Oral fluid testing windows
- Metabolite mapping by specimen type
- DEA scheduling classification
- Alternate name mapping (common/street names)
- Administration route metadata
- Drug category cross-references

### Categorization System
Cross-referenced drug categories include:
- Opioids
- Stimulants
- Additional categories (implied but not explicitly listed)

### Metadata Relationships
The database maintains relationships between:
- Primary drug entries and their metabolites
- Drugs and their DEA schedule classifications
- Common names and formal nomenclature
- Administration routes and detection windows
- Drug categories and member substances

### Integration Points
The database structure integrates with:
- SVT analysis system for result interpretation
- Drug testing knowledge base for clinical protocols
- AI assistant knowledge base for procedure guidance

Importance Score: 90/100
