# data-flow

Core Data Processing Pipeline:

1. Specimen Collection Input
- Collection Checklist System (src/data/checklistData.js) validates initial specimen data
- Enforces form completion and test code validation rules
- Forwards validated specimen data to SVT analysis

2. SVT Analysis Processing
- SVT system (src/data/svtColorData.js) processes specimen validity parameters:
  * Color data interpretation for OX/PCC, Creatinine, Specific Gravity, pH
  * Maps color values to clinical interpretations
  * Generates validity testing results with required actions

3. Vision Analysis Integration
- AI Vision system (api/vision.js) processes SVT strip photos
- Interprets color data for 4 test parameters
- Generates confidence scores
- Outputs structured validation results

4. Drug Testing Knowledge Flow
- Drug database (src/data/drugDatabase.js) provides reference data:
  * Detection window information
  * Metabolite tracking
  * Cross-referenced drug categories
- Integrates with test results for interpretation

5. Result Generation Pipeline
- Combines SVT analysis results
- Incorporates drug testing reference data
- Applies clinical validation rules from AI knowledge base
- Produces final interpreted results with required actions

Critical Data Validations:
- Specimen collection protocol verification
- Chain of custody requirement checks
- Clinical cutoff level validation
- THC/Creatinine ratio calculations
- Adulterant detection verification
