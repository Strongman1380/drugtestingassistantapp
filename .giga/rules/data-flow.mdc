# data-flow

Core Data Processing Pipeline:

1. SVT Specimen Processing Flow
- Input: Raw specimen validity test strip data
- SVTColorChecker.jsx analyzes color parameters
- Vision AI integration performs automated detection
- Validates against svtColorData.js reference values
- Outputs: Multi-parameter validity assessment
Importance Score: 95/100

2. Drug Testing Knowledge Flow
- Drug reference database provides testing metadata
- AI Assistant consumes knowledge base for interpretations
- Validates against detection windows and cutoff levels
- Generates contextual testing recommendations
Importance Score: 90/100

3. Result Generation Pipeline
- SVT color analysis results feed into validation system
- Combines specimen validity data with drug test results
- Applies medical-grade interpretation rules
- Produces final clinical assessment
Importance Score: 85/100

Key Data Integration Points:

1. Vision Analysis -> SVT Processing
Path: api/vision.js -> src/components/SVTColorChecker.jsx
